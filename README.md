# Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Description

This project enhances a fully functioning Tech Quiz application by implementing comprehensive testing using Cypress. The app, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score. The assignment involves writing both component and end-to-end tests for the quiz functionality, ensuring that it is reliable and robust under various conditions.

The application aims to test knowledge on technical topics, and with the added Cypress tests, the goal is to ensure the application performs as expected during real-world usage.
